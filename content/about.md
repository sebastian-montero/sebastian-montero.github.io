**Hello, my name is Sebastian.**

I am an engineer from Costa Rica working in deep learning, recsys and agentic systems. I currently live in London, UK.

Currently, I'm a Lead ML/AI Engineer building Beamery's AI capabilities. At Beamery, I have led several R&D projects, including the company's first talent recommendation system, engagement and skill inference deep learning models, finetuning large language models, and more.

In the past, I worked on McKinsey & Company’s Startup and Investment Landscape Analytics team to advise clients on their M&A strategies using NLP.

In my free time, I have built several apps, including a movie recommendation system based on the user's mood, a personalized blog aggregator, and a real-time creative writing tool. Apart from work, I enjoy music production, film photography, and running a small movie club. I’m also a blue belt in brazilian jiu jitsu. I also created this font heavily inspired by wim crouwel's new alphabet.
