## Hi! My name is Sebastian.

I am a senior machine learning engineer at [Beamery](https://beamery.com/about-us/), specializing in search and recommendation systems that leverage deep learning and generative AI. Originally from Costa Rica, I lived in Madrid, Spain from 2018-19, before relocating to London, UK in 2019, where I now reside.

My projects at Beamery include:

- **AI Talent Match**: Built Beamery's talent recommendation system using a coupled GNN-LM architecture, grounded with our proprietary knowledge graph (KG). For prod, I developed distributed data processing ETL pipelines to index tens of millions of candidate documents in our vector search engine.
- **Skills Inference Model**: R&D of Beamery's skill inference model, leveraging people's experiences with an RNN and MoE architecture.
- **Multi-entity Recommendation Model**: R&D of Beamery's multi-entity recommendation model, using GNN for node embedding representations.
- **Candidate Engagement Model**: R&D of Beamery's candidate engagement model, utilizing tree-based models for predictive analytics.
- **End-to-end BI Solution**: Introduced BI improvements, including Airflow schedulers for ETL pipelines and Tableau for business reporting.


Previous work and other projects:

- **McKinsey & Company's Startup & Investment Analytics**: Worked with Fortune 500 clients to generate NLP-based networks of startup ecosystems. These reports were used to analyze startup landscapes and investment trends, informing clients' M&A strategies.
- **McKinsey & Company's Patent Analytics**: Worked with Fortune 500 clients to map innovation trends across various industries using patent publications and NLP-based techniques.
- **Moodflix**: In this personal project, I developed a movie recommendation engine that leverages LLM encoding and static vector indexes to suggest films based on the user's mood. ([link](https://moodflix.streamlit.app))
- **BlogLog**: In this personal project, I developed a blog-based social app that enables users to save and rate blogs. Users can follow their friends to view and save their reading activity, fostering a social reading experience.
- **OSS Contributions**: Contributed to open source projects such as _pyg-team/pytorch_geometric_ and _openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin_.


Outside of work, I also enjoy:

- Playing guitar and [music production](https://soundcloud.com/smxnt/popular-tracks)
- Running a movie club with 10 active members
- Practicing street film photography and [brutalist architecture photography](/brutalism)
- Practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
