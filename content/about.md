## Hi! My name is Sebastian

I'm an engineer curious about how technology can change our lives for the better. Originally from Costa Rica, I spent some time in Madrid before moving to London, where I currently live. When I'm not working, building or hacking, I enjoy staying active and diving into creative projects.

I work as a senior machine learning engineer/data scientist building Beamery's [[1]](https://beamery.com/about-us/) deep learning capabilities and recommendation systems. During my tenure at Beamery, I have led the research and development of several greenfield projects:

- The first **talent recommendation system** [[2]](https://beamery.com/resources/sourcing/uncover-top-talent-fast-with-ai-talent-match) using a coupled GNN-LM architecture, powered by a proprietary knowledge graph (KG), with distributed ETL pipelines to index tens of millions of candidate documents in a vector search engine.
- A **multi-entity recommendation engine** that leverages GNNs for node embedding retrieval.
- A **skill inference model** utilizing a coupled RNN-to-MoE architecture to re-rank inferred skills from individuals' experiences.
- A **candidate engagement model** that utilizes tree-based models for predictive analytics to improve candidate interaction strategies.
- The first **end-to-end BI solution**, introducing improvements such as Airflow schedulers for ETL pipelines and Tableau for business reporting.

<br/>
In the past I have:

- Worked at **McKinsey & Company** [[3]](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/start-me-up-where-mobility-investments-are-going), advising Fortune 500 clients on their M&A strategies with NLP-based analytic solutions that map startup ecosystems and patent publications to uncover investment and innovation trends.
- Developed **Moodflix** [[4]](https://moodflix.streamlit.app), a movie recommendation engine that uses LLM encoding and static vector indexes to suggest films based on the user's mood.
- Developed **BlogLog**, a blog-based social app that allows users to save and rate blogs while following friends to track and engage with their reading activity, creating a shared social reading experience.
- Contributed to open source projects like PyTorch Geometric [[5]](https://github.com/sebastian-montero/pytorch_geometric) and OpenAI's ChatGPT retrieval plugin  [[6]](https://github.com/sebastian-montero/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin).

<br/>
Apart from work, I also enjoy music production [[7]](https://soundcloud.com/smxnt/popular-tracks), film street photography [[8]](/brutalism), practising submission grappling, and running a small movie club [[9]](https://letterboxd.com/smxnt/list/viking-movie-club/).
