## Hi! My name is Sebastian

I‚Äôm an engineer curious about how technology can change our lives for the better. Originally from Costa Rica, I spent some time in Madrid before moving to London, where I currently live. When I‚Äôm not working, building or hacking, I enjoy staying active and diving into creative projects.

I work as a senior machine learning engineer/data scientist building [Beamery](https://beamery.com/about-us/)'s deep learning capabilities and recommendation systems. During my tenure at Beamery, I have led the research and development of several greenfield projects:

- The first **talent recommendation system** using a coupled GNN-LM architecture, powered by a proprietary knowledge graph (KG), with distributed ETL pipelines to index tens of millions of candidate documents in a vector search engine.
- A **multi-entity recommendation engine** that leverages GNNs for node embedding retrieval.
- A **skill inference model** utilizing a coupled RNN-to-MoE architecture to re-rank inferred skills from individuals' experiences.
- A **candidate engagement model** that utilizes tree-based models for predictive analytics to improve candidate interaction strategies.
- The first **end-to-end BI solution**, introducing improvements such as Airflow schedulers for ETL pipelines and Tableau for business reporting.

<br/>
In the past I have:

- Worked at **McKinsey & Company**, advising Fortune 500 clients on their M&A strategies with NLP-based analytic solutions that map startup ecosystems and patent publications to uncover investment and innovation trends.
- Developed **Moodflix**, a movie recommendation engine that uses LLM encoding and static vector indexes to suggest films based on the user's mood. [here](https://moodflix.streamlit.app)
- Developed **BlogLog**, a blog-based social app that allows users to save and rate blogs while following friends to track and engage with their reading activity, creating a shared social reading experience.
- Contributed to open source projects including PyTorch Geometric and OpenAI's retrieval plugin.

<br/>
Apart from work, I also enjoy [music production](https://soundcloud.com/smxnt/popular-tracks), [film street photography](/brutalism), practising submission grappling, and running a small movie club.
