## Hi! My name is Sebastian

Welcome to my website! I‚Äôm an engineer curious about how technology can change our lives for the better. Originally from Costa Rica, I spent some time in Madrid before moving to London, where I currently live. When I‚Äôm not working, building or hacking, I enjoy staying active and diving into creative projects.

I work as a senior machine learning engineer/data scientist at [Beamery](https://beamery.com/about-us/), specializing in search and recommendation systems that leverage deep learning and generative AI. 

<br/>
At Beamery, I have led the research and development of several projects, including:

- The first **talent recommendation system** using a coupled GNN-LM architecture, powered by a proprietary knowledge graph (KG), with distributed ETL pipelines to index tens of millions of candidate documents in a vector search engine.
- A **multi-entity recommendation engine** that leverages GNNs for node embedding retrieval.
- A **skill inference model** utilizing a coupled RNN-to-MoE architecture to re-rank inferred skills from individuals' experiences.
- A **candidate engagement model** that utilizes tree-based models for predictive analytics to improve candidate interaction strategies.
- The first **end-to-end BI solution**, introducing improvements such as Airflow schedulers for ETL pipelines and Tableau for business reporting.

<br/>
My previous work and other projects can be found below:

- Worked as a Research Analyst at **McKinsey & Company**, advising Fortune 500 clients on their M&A strategies with NLP-based analytic solutions that map startup ecosystems and patent publications to uncover investment and innovation trends.
- Developed **Moodflix**, a movie recommendation engine that uses LLM encoding and static vector indexes to suggest films based on the user's mood. (link)
- Developed **BlogLog**, a blog-based social app that allows users to save and rate blogs while following friends to track and engage with their reading activity, creating a shared social reading experience.
- Contributed to open source projects including PyTorch Geometric and OpenAI's retrieval plugin.

<br/>
I also enjoy:

- Playing guitar and [music production](https://soundcloud.com/smxnt/popular-tracks)
- Running a movie club with 10 active members
- Shooting street film photography and [brutalist architecture photography](/brutalism)
- Grappling and BJJ
- If it is not too cold, sailing or swimming
