## Hi! My name is **Sebastian**.

I'm an engineer curious about how technology can change our lives for the better. Originally from Costa Rica, I spent some time in Madrid before moving to London in 2019, where I currently live. When I'm not working, building, or hacking, I enjoy diving into creative projects and staying active.

I work as a senior machine learning engineer/data scientist building [Beamery](https://beamery.com/about-us/)'s deep learning capabilities and recommendation systems. During my tenure at Beamery, I have led the research and development of several greenfield projects, including:

- The first [talent recommendation system](https://beamery.com/resources/sourcing/uncover-top-talent-fast-with-ai-talent-match) using a coupled GNN-LM architecture as it's core matching model, powered by our proprietary knowledge graph (KG). The system uses distributed ETL pipelines to index tens of millions of vectorized candidate documents and other data in a search engine.
- A multi-entity recommendation engine utilizing GNNs for entity matching and retrieval across various interconnected talent attributes.
- A skill inference model utilizing a coupled RNN-to-MoE architecture to re-rank inferred skills from individuals' experiences.
- A candidate engagement model that utilizes tree-based models for predictive analytics to improve candidate interaction strategies.
- The first end-to-end BI solution, introducing improvements such as Airflow schedulers for ETL pipelines and Tableau for business reporting.

Past work and other projects:

- Worked at McKinsey & Company developing the [SILA analytics solution](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/start-me-up-where-mobility-investments-are-going) to advise Fortune 500 clients on their M&A strategies using startup ecosystems and patent publications.
- Developed [BlogLog](https://bloglog.incendia.dev), a blog-based social app that allows users to save and rate blogs while following friends to track and engage with their reading activity, creating a shared social reading experience.
- Developed [Moodflix](https://moodflix.incendia.dev), a movie recommendation engine that uses LLM encoding and static vector indexes to suggest films based on the user's mood.
- Contributed to open source projects like [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/sebastian-montero/pytorch_geometric) and OpenAI's [ChatGPT retrieval plugin](https://github.com/sebastian-montero/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin).

Apart from work, I also enjoy [music production](https://soundcloud.com/smxnt/popular-tracks), [film street photography](/brutalism), practising submission grappling, and running a small [movie club](https://letterboxd.com/smxnt/list/viking-movie-club/).
