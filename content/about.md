**Hello, my name is Sebastian.**

I am an engineer from Costa Rica working in deep learning, recsys and agentic systems. I currently live in London, UK.

At my last job, I was a Lead ML/AI Engineer at an HR Tech scaleup. At the company, I worked on several R&D projects, including the company's first talent recommendation system, user engagement models, skill inference using graph learning, fine tuning large language models, and more.

In the past, I worked on McKs Startup Analytics team to give clients better insights on their M&A strategies using NLP and graphs.

In my free time, I have built several lightweight web apps. These include a movie recsys based on the person's mood, a personalized blog aggregator that used web scraping and LLMs to curate the content, and a writing tool that streams your writing process to viewers. Apart from work, I enjoy music production, film photography and travel. Iâ€™m also a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
