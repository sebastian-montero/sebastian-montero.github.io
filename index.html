<h2>Hi! My name is Sebastian</h2>

<p>Welcome to my website! I‚Äôm an engineer curious about how technology can change our lives for the better. Originally from Costa Rica, I spent some time in Madrid before moving to London, where I currently live. When I‚Äôm not working, building or hacking, I enjoy staying active and diving into creative projects.</p>

<p>I work as a senior machine learning engineer/data scientist at <a href="https://beamery.com/about-us/">Beamery</a>, specializing in search and recommendation systems that leverage deep learning and generative AI.</p>

<p><br/>
At Beamery, I have led the research and development of several projects, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first <strong>talent recommendation system</strong> using a coupled GNN-LM architecture, powered by a proprietary knowledge graph (KG), with distributed ETL pipelines to index tens of millions of candidate documents in a vector search engine.</li>
<li>A <strong>multi-entity recommendation engine</strong> that leverages GNNs for node embedding retrieval.</li>
<li>A <strong>skill inference model</strong> utilizing a coupled RNN-to-MoE architecture to re-rank inferred skills from individuals&rsquo; experiences.</li>
<li>A <strong>candidate engagement model</strong> that utilizes tree-based models for predictive analytics to improve candidate interaction strategies.</li>
<li>The first <strong>end-to-end BI solution</strong>, introducing improvements such as Airflow schedulers for ETL pipelines and Tableau for business reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
My previous work and other projects can be found below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Worked as a Research Analyst at <strong>McKinsey &amp; Company</strong>, advising Fortune 500 clients on their M&amp;A strategies with NLP-based analytic solutions that map startup ecosystems and patent publications to uncover investment and innovation trends.</li>
<li>Developed <strong>Moodflix</strong>, a movie recommendation engine that uses LLM encoding and static vector indexes to suggest films based on the user&rsquo;s mood. (link)</li>
<li>Developed <strong>BlogLog</strong>, a blog-based social app that allows users to save and rate blogs while following friends to track and engage with their reading activity, creating a shared social reading experience.</li>
<li>Contributed to open source projects including PyTorch Geometric and OpenAI&rsquo;s retrieval plugin.</li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
I also enjoy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Playing guitar and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/smxnt/popular-tracks">music production</a></li>
<li>Running a movie club with 10 active members</li>
<li>Shooting street film photography and <a href="/brutalism">brutalist architecture photography</a></li>
<li>Grappling and BJJ</li>
<li>If it is not too cold, sailing or swimming</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to chat, please reach out through any of my socials. I rotate my email with Hide My Email to avoid spam so in case you reach out, I&rsquo;ll reply with my actual email. üõ∞Ô∏è</p>
