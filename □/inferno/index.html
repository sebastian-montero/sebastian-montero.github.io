      <p><strong>🪦 star [feb 2024]</strong>: The STyle And Recommendation (STAR) system was a computer vision-based application to detect
        a person's clothing styles based on their photos. This approach, coupled with personality questions and GPT-3.5 turbo 
        allowed us to create personal style recommendations for the users. The app was developed completely in Python using 
        Streamlit as its front-end for user testing. STAR was built as part of a working group exploring AI applied to fashion,
        however the group decided pursue to pursue part ways to pursue other personal goals.</p>
      <p><strong>🪦 tukio [aug 2023]</strong>: Event-based social platform. Tukio was meant to be a social platform to meet people and go to events
      based on similar interests. The goal of Tukio was to allow people to connect with others so they can disconnect. I stopped Tukio development
      because of the challenge to get events funneled into the platform. This was done with massive online scrapers for testing; however, this approach
      enters a legal gray area. Tukio's severs were build using Python.</p>
      <p><strong>🪦 luna writing [jul 2023]</strong>: Luna was a one day hack building LLM-based writing assistant. This was an end-to-end 
        tool for bloggers. Luna would help writers improve their writing along the creation and ideation phase. Once they finished their 
        post, Luna would help them convert their content into twitter or instagram posts, summarise it or transform it into script for 
        video creation. Future stages were planned to create trending topic features to inspire writers. Luna was build using Python And
        Streamlit as its front-end.</p>
      <p><strong>🪦 bookmates [jun 2020]</strong>: Book sharing platform. I only built the front-end that mocked the 
        interaction of users submitting and trading books with other users close to them. The app was built as a front-end tooling discovery 
        using Javascript.</p>
      <p><strong>🪦 pestofreaks [jul 2020]</strong>: Attempt at creating a foodie content Instagram bot that would scrape images of 
        pasta and repost them (giving credits to the original posters ofc). This app was written in Python. Fun fact: the app got taken down
        after one user reported it several times and sent several angry dms because it would continuously posted their cat named Pesto.</p>
      <p><strong>🪦 recyclo [dec 2019]</strong>: Computer vision-based iOS app trained with Microsoft Azure computer vision on thousands
        of images to classify different types of waste.</p>
      <p><strong>🪦 tw topic analyzer [jul 2019]</strong>: Experiments with data streaming. This application tracked specific topics across
        geographies on Twitter and analyzed the audience sentiment. Written with Python, Kafka, Cassandra DB and Grafana.</p>
