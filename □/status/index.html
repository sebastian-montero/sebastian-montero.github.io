    <p>> 22 oct 2024: did good progress with writeout today. I implemented all http interfaces. Now, I need to enter unexplored territory and implement the websockets for real
      time communication. </p>
    <p>> oct 2024: started building write out. a stream-based writing app to follow the creative process of others. written with go. i am building this app to learn
      how to build a scalable application with go. the biggest challenge, apart from learning go, is to use websockets to stream the writing process.

    <p>> oct 2024: one week set up of my home lab to host media, serve personal applications, and share mvp of apps to the world</p>
    <p>> sept 2024: did a one week hack of bloglog - a blog sharing social platform to see what your friends have bookmarked and have read. 
     Similar to Goodreads and Letterboxd, but applied to blogs. bloglog was build using Python, JS, Airflow and Mongo. The application is still under development,
     the missing pieces before validation with friends is changing Airflow for a more memory-efficient job scheduler. After validation changes, bloglog will still miss
     proper authentication and authorization, before deployment. </p>
